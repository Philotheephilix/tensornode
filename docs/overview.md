# TensorNode Overview

## What is TensorNode?

TensorNode is a revolutionary decentralized AI infrastructure platform that combines the power of distributed computing with blockchain technology. Built on the Hedera network, TensorNode enables developers and organizations to deploy, scale, and monetize AI models across a global network of decentralized nodes.

## Core Concepts

### Decentralized AI Network
TensorNode operates as a peer-to-peer network where participants can contribute computing resources (miners) or validate network quality (validators). This creates a robust, censorship-resistant AI infrastructure that doesn't rely on centralized cloud providers.

### Blockchain Integration
The platform leverages Hedera's consensus mechanism and smart contracts to:
- Track node registrations and performance
- Distribute rewards fairly
- Ensure transparent governance
- Maintain immutable audit trails

### Multi-Modal AI Support
TensorNode supports various AI model types:
- **Large Language Models (LLM)** - Text generation and understanding
- **Computer Vision** - Image analysis and processing
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** - Audio transcription
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - Voice synthesis
- **Translation** - Multi-language text translation
- **Embeddings** - Vector representations for semantic search

## Key Participants

### Miners
Miners provide computational resources by:
- Deploying AI models on virtual machines
- Processing inference requests
- Earning rewards based on performance and availability
- Contributing to network decentralization

### Validators
Validators ensure network quality by:
- Submitting test queries to miners
- Scoring response quality and accuracy
- Participating in consensus mechanisms
- Earning rewards for validation work

### Developers
Developers integrate with TensorNode through:
- REST APIs for programmatic access
- WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Smart contract interfaces for on-chain operations
- SDKs and libraries for common languages
